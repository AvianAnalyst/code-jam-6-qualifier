# Kivy Application Qualifier

- **Deadline:** 2020-01-10 12:00 UTC
- **Submission form:** https://forms.gle/MzzZs9mFMKe2bwP77
- **Theme suggestions:** https://forms.gle/ejkha9bF6kKjnRJJA

This qualifier task for the upcoming Winter Code Jam is to write a Kivy
application, where you can move an image, (suggestion, the python
discord logo, or the game jam logo), with arrow keys of your keyboards.

### Code Style & Readability
While not a hard requirement, we will take code style and readability into account when judging submissions for both the qualifier as well as the code jam itself. Please try to keep your code readable for yourself and others, and try to comply with [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). To check if your code follows PEP 8, we will use a tool called [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) configured with a maximum line length of 100. If you want to run flake8 yourself, you can use `flake8 --max-line-length=100 /path/to/code` to run it with the same settings as we will use. (Note: you will need to [install flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/index.html#installation) first.)

- **Please note that the qualifier task is supposed to be an individual challenge.** This means that you should not discuss (parts of) your solution to the qualifier task in public (including our server) and that you should try to solve it individually. Obviously, this does not mean that you can't do research or ask questions about the Python concepts you're using to solve the qualifier, but try to use general examples when you post code during this process.
